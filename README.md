For this project, you will be creating what is called a "Fork" of this project. A forked repository allows you to easily collaborate with other people
within the same codebase.

TODO: More explanation?

1 member from your group should fork the repository.

TODO: Add Fork Image

### Manage Access

That member should add each group member to the repository.

1. Click Settings
2. Manage Access
3. Add People
4. Add jcollard as well as your other group members.

### Clone Repository

Each person should now clone the project to their computer.

## Team work flow

Never commit to the main branch! This can cause problems for your entire team. You should *ALWAYS* work on a new branch and create pull requests when you're ready to combine your work.

### Creating a Branch

Create a branch that matches your name. This is the branch where you will do all of your own work.

Add your name to the `Authors` Section of the WordGuesser/README.md document.

Create a pull request to the `main` branch.
Add your group members a reviewer.

### Merge a Pull Request

Create a pull request from your `main` branch to the `ChadwickCSP/main` branch.
Add Mx. Collard as a reviewer.

This is where you will receive feedback from Mx. Collard.
